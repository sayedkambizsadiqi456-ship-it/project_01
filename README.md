🛒 GladFul — Online Grocery Store UI

A modern single-page grocery shopping web app built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
GladFul provides an interactive shopping experience with product filtering, cart management, checkout modal, animations, and responsive design — all without any frameworks.

This project is part of my frontend portfolio and demonstrates strong skills in UI design, DOM manipulation, and state management using vanilla JavaScript.

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository

🧠 How It Works

Products are stored in JavaScript arrays.

The UI is rendered dynamically using DOM manipulation.

The cart is managed with a JavaScript state array.

Totals update automatically on every cart change.

CSS animations handle transitions and micro-interactions.

The checkout form simulates an order and resets the cart.

📱 Responsive Design

Desktop: Fixed sidebar with product grid

Tablet: Collapsible sidebar

Mobile: Hamburger menu with overlay and full-width layout

⚠️ Limitations

This is a frontend demo project:

No backend or database

No real payments

Cart data is not saved after page refresh

🔮 Future Improvements

LocalStorage cart persistence

Backend API integration

User authentication

Dark mode toggle

Multi-page routing

Real payment gateway integration
